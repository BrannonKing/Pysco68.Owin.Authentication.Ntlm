# Pysco68.Owin.Authentication.NTLM

A passive NTLM autentication middleware for OWIN. This middleware enables you to use NTLM authentication independently of IIS or HTTPListener. Additionally, being a passive middleware, it will enable you to use local application accounts with Windows Authentication as yet anoter mean of authentication!
